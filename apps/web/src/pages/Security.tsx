        <h2>Data flow</h2>
        <p>
          A host machine runs a WebSocket server on port <code>7788</code> and advertises
          itself over mDNS. Clients on the same LAN discover the host, request to join,
          and — upon approval — receive file metadata and on-demand byte streams.
        </p>
        <p>
          No traffic leaves the local network. There is no back-channel to us, to any
          cloud provider, or to any third-party service. Session codes are random,
          short-lived identifiers; they grant nothing outside the local session.
        </p>

      <section className="doc-section">
        <h2>Threat model</h2>
        <p>
          LanSync Studio assumes a trusted local network. It is designed for studios,
          offices, classrooms, and labs where participants have already been vetted.
          It is <strong>not</strong> intended as a public file-drop or as a substitute for
          end-to-end encrypted messaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within a trusted LAN, the following protections apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All join requests require host approval — no auto-accept mode.</li>
          <li>Session codes are randomly generated per workspace and rotate on restart.</li>
          <li>Revoked clients are disconnected immediately and cannot reconnect without a new approval.</li>
          <li>Edits are serialized through the host; clients cannot modify each other's state directly.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
